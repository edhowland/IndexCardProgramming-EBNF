# 3X5 Card programming: Writing your first Grammar rules

## Abstract

Let's create a grammar for a very tiny subset of JSON
This will only take about 8 lines of Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF)

## Rationale

By repeatedly performing this small exercise, you begin to build muscle memory
which reinforces your skill set for creating lgrammars, which helps you understand
other's BNF rules you might encounter.

## Regular Expressions

This example shows the precedence of the various  RegExp operators

0. '(', ')' : Grouping
1. '*', '+' and '?' : Repetition : Postfix operator
2. Concatenation
3. . '|' : Alternation : Infix operator
